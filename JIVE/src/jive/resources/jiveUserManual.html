	<h1> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started </h1>

		<h2> 1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Opening an Image File </h2>

		<p> 
			To open an image file, select the menu button then select &apos;Open File&apos;, or press Ctrl+O. 
			The menu button is the only button that is enabled when no image is loaded. 
			JIVE supports .jpg, .gif, .bmp, and .png files. 
			Attempting to open any other file type will result in an error message. 
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/OpenFile.png" width="85%" height="85%">
			</div>
		</p>

		<h2> 1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Resizing the Window </h2>

		<p> 
			Window resizing is handled by your operating system, including snap resizing. 
			If an image is loaded it will be resized as necessary to fit into the viewer. 
			The aspect ratio will always be preserved.
		</p>
		
		<h2> 1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Photo Reel </h2>
		
		<p>
			After an image is loaded, other image files in the same directory are loaded to the photo reel. The photo reel bypasses the file chooser
			and loads the next or previous image from the directory into JIVE. Images are loaded in alphabetical order. 
			The previous or next image can be loaded by pressing Ctrl+Left or Ctrl+Right, respectively. 
			Or, by using the following buttons:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/PreviousIcon.png" hspace="40">
			<img src="./icons/NextIcon.png" hspace="40">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The buttons are only displayed when the mouse is hovered over them. The relative location is shown below:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/PhotoReel.png" width="90%" height="90%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			If there are no next or previous pictures, the corresponding button will not be displayed and the keyboard shortcut will be disabled. 
			If the current image has unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save the changes before the new image is loaded.
		</p>

		<h2> 1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard Shortcuts </h2>

		<p> 
			Keyboard shortcuts for certain functions are noted in the relevant sections of this manual. 
			They are also listed below for reference:
			<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
				<li>Ctrl+O: Open a new file</li>
				<li>Ctrl+S: Save the current project</li>
				<li>Ctrl+Z: Undo</li>
				<li>Ctrl+Y: Redo</li>
				<li>Ctrl+Left: Previous image</li>
				<li>Ctrl+Right: Next image</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<hr style="border-width:2px">
		
	<h1> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing Images </h1>
	
		<p> 
			This section discusses how to use JIVE&apos;s image editing functions. 

			The editing buttons are only enabled after an image is loaded.

			If there is any confusion regarding button function during use, users can hover their mouse over any of the buttons to receive a tooltip specifying the button&apos;s function.

		</p>

		<h2> 2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be rotated 90 degrees at a time. Users can rotate an image clockwise or counter-clockwise with these buttons, respectively:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/CwRotateIcon.png" hspace="40">
			<img src="./icons/CcwRotateIcon.png" hspace="40">
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h2> 2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Flipping </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be flipped (or mirrored) horizontally and vertically. The flip functions are controlled by the following buttons:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/HorizontalFlipIcon.png" hspace="40">
			<img src="./icons/VerticalFlipIcon.png" hspace="40">
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h2> 2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cropping </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be cropped using the crop tool, which is opened by pressing the crop button:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/CropIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the crop tool you can select the area to crop by clicking and dragging your mouse over the image to create a rectangle. The area of the image outside of the blue rectangle will be removed:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/CropTool.png" width="90%" height="90%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The following buttons can be used to return to the main editing panel or proceed with the operation:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/CancelIcon.png" hspace="40">
			<img src="./icons/ConfirmIcon.png" hspace="40">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The cancel button (left) can be pressed at any time to exit the crop tool without making changes. 
			The confirm button (right) will only be enabled when a crop area is selected. 
			Pressing the confirm button executes the crop operation and exits the crop tool. 
		</p>
		
		<h2> 2.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Resizing </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be scaled down using the resize tool. Open the tool using the following button:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/ResizeIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>	
			Use the slider in the resize tool to select the percent to resize by. New image dimensions are previewed under the &quot;New Dimensions:&quot; label:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/ResizeTool.png" width="85%" height="85%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			Like the crop function above, the cancel button will exit the resize tool without making changes and the confirm button will commence the resize operation. 
			The confirm button will be disabled if the slider is at 100% or if the new dimensions are less than 1 x 1.
			<br>
			<br>
			<font color="red">NOTE:</font> Resizing images typically results in some loss in quality.
		</p>
		
		<h2> 2.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;Brightness and Contrast </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Image brightness and contrast can be adjusted by clicking this button:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/BrightnessContrastIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			This will display two sliders - the top slider adjusts the brightness and the bottom adjusts contrast. 
			Brightness and contrast are increased or decreased by moving the sliders to the right or left, respectively.
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/BrightnessTool.png" width="85%" height="85%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The brightness and contrast adjustments are shown real-time in the image viewer.
			Similar to the crop and resize functions, the cancel button will cancel the operation and the confirm button will apply the changes.
		</p>

	<h1> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing Your Changes </h1>

		<h2> 3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Undo </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Changes to your project can undone by pressing Ctrl+Z or using the undo button in the upper left-hand corner:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/UndoIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The history of changes to your project is stored until the program is closed or a new image is opened. 
			This button is disabled when there are no changes to undo. 
			&apos;Save As&apos; actions are not stored and cannot be undone.
		</p>
		
		<h2> 3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Redo </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Undone changes can be redone with Ctrl+Y or the redo button:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/RedoIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			This button is disabled when there are no changes to redo. 
			The undo history is only stored immediately after changes are undone. 
			If a new editing function is performed the undo history is cleared and the redo button is disabled.
		</p>
		
		<h2> 3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Save </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be saved using the save button next to the menu button or by pressing Ctrl+S:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./icons/SaveIcon.png">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			This will save any changes made to the image. The button will be disabled if there are no changes to save. 
			Once an image is edited, the button will be enabled and an asterisk(*) will be appended to the displayed name. 
			<br><br>
			<font color="red">WARNING:</font> This button will always overwrite the image file that is open in JIVE.
		</p>
		
		<h2> 3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Save As </h2>
		
		<p> 
			Images can be saved as different names, in different directories, and as different file types using the save as feature:
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/SaveAs.png" width="85%" height="85%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			On-click, JIVE will open a file explorer (Windows 10 shown below):
			<br>
			<div class="image">
			<img src="./screenshots/SaveAsExplorer.png" width="85%" height="85%">
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can then navigate to the desired destination directory. 
			File name can be edited by typing in the text box and file type can be selected using the file-type drop-down list.
			<br><br>
			Images can be converted to any of the compatible formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, or GIF).
			<br><br>
			The file type can be selected from the drop-down menu or appended to the file name. 
			For example, entering the file name &quot;image.jpg&quot; will convert the image to a JPG and override the file type in the &quot;Save As Type:&quot; list.
			If no file extension is appended to the file name, JIVE will save the image as the file type selected in the &quot;Save As Type:&quot; drop-down menu.
			<br><br>
			The current image file will stay open in JIVE. The newly saved image will not be opened automatically.
			<br><br>
			<font color="red">NOTE:</font> JPGs and BMPs do not support transparency. 
			If you are converting from a PNG or GIF with transparency, the transparent pixels will be converted to white. 
			Transparency is preserved when converting between PNG and GIF.
